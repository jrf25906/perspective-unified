- [ ] Empty states
- [ ] Loading states
- [ ] Error states

### Priority 3: Advanced Features
- [ ] Echo Score history
- [ ] Achievements view
- [ ] Insights & recommendations
- [ ] Debug/API test view

## Phase 3: High Fidelity (Week 3)

### Visual Design
- [ ] Apply visual design to all wireframes
- [ ] Create illustrations for empty states
- [ ] Design achievement badges
- [ ] Create data visualization components
- [ ] Design micro-interactions

### Prototyping
- [ ] Link main navigation flows
- [ ] Create challenge flow prototype
- [ ] Add hover states and transitions
- [ ] Create onboarding flow
- [ ] Test all interactive elements

## Phase 4: Handoff Prep (Week 4)

### Documentation
- [ ] Add component documentation
- [ ] Specify animation timings
- [ ] Create style guide
- [ ] Document interaction patterns
- [ ] Mark all exportable assets

### Developer Handoff
- [ ] Review and name all layers properly
- [ ] Set up proper constraints/auto-layout
- [ ] Export design tokens
- [ ] Create component specs
- [ ] Prepare asset export settings

## Quick Tips for Play App Efficiency

### Play App Shortcuts
- `⌘D` - Duplicate
- `⌘G` - Group elements
- `⌘K` - Create component
- `⌘⌥K` - Create component variant
- `Space` - Pan around canvas

### Best Practices
1. **Use iOS Auto Layout** for responsive components
2. **Name layers** descriptively (e.g., "button/primary/default")
3. **Create component variants** for different states
4. **Follow iOS spacing** (8pt grid system)
5. **Test on device** - Play's iOS preview feature

### Play App Resources to Import
- iOS 17 Design System
- SF Symbols 5 library
- iOS Navigation Components
- Dynamic Type text styles
- iOS Color System

## Time Estimates

| Phase | Duration | Hours/Day |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| Foundation | 1 week | 4-6 hours |
| Wireframes | 1 week | 6-8 hours |
| High Fidelity | 1 week | 6-8 hours |
| Handoff Prep | 1 week | 4-6 hours |

**Total Timeline**: 4 weeks for complete design system and screens

## Daily Workflow

### Morning
1. Review yesterday's work
2. Check design consistency
3. Start with highest priority items

### During Design
1. Test components as you build
2. Get feedback early and often
3. Keep developer constraints in mind

### End of Day
1. Organize and name layers
2. Update component documentation
3. Export work-in-progress for review
