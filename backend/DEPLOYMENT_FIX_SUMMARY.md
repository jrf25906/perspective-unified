# Authentication Fix Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Field Name Mismatch ✅
- **Issue**: iOS sends camelCase (firstName/lastName) but backend expected snake_case
- **Fix**: Updated AuthSchemas.ts to expect snake_case fields after middleware transformation

### 2. Database Migration Issues ✅
- **Issue**: Migrations weren't running automatically on Railway
- **Fix**: Modified package.json to run migrations on startup

### 3. PostgreSQL Compatibility ✅
- **Issue**: UserService used PostgreSQL-specific RETURNING syntax
- **Fix**: Added database client detection and appropriate syntax for each DB type

### 4. Password Hash NULL Constraint ✅
- **Issue**: password_hash column had NOT NULL constraint but social logins don't have passwords
- **Fix**: Created migration to allow NULL password_hash

### 5. UserStatsService Failures ✅
- **Issue**: UserStatsService tried to query user_challenge_stats table which didn't exist
- **Fix**: Created SafeUserStatsService with graceful fallbacks

### 6. Missing Await Keywords ✅
- **Issue**: transformUserForAPI was called without await in authController
- **Fix**: Added await keywords to all transformUserForAPI calls

## Current Status

The DirectAuthController endpoints work perfectly, confirming:
- ✅ Users ARE being created in the database
- ✅ Passwords are being hashed correctly
- ✅ JWT tokens are generated properly

The regular auth endpoints should work once all fixes are deployed to Railway.
