# Refactoring Changes Summary

This document summarizes the systematic refactoring done to address code duplication and improve the codebase following SOLID principles.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Extracted Authentication Checks** ✅
- Removed manual authentication checks from controllers (ProfileController, EchoScoreController)
- Controllers now rely on `authRequired` middleware applied at the route level
- Simplified controller methods to focus on business logic only

### 2. **Centralized Environment Configuration** ✅
- Environment variables are already centrally loaded in `config.ts`
- Removed duplicate `dotenv.config()` calls from other files

### 3. **Improved Type-Safe Dependency Injection** ✅
- The DI container already uses typed tokens with `ServiceToken<T>`
- Added `EchoScoreService` to the centralized `ServiceTokens`
- Removed duplicate service token definitions

### 4. **Converted Static Services to Injectable** ✅
- `EchoScoreService` is already a class that accepts DB through constructor
- Registered in the DI container with proper dependency injection

### 5. **Application Factory for Testing** ✅
- `createApp()` and `createTestApp()` already exist in `app.ts`
- Created additional test utilities in `testUtils/testFactory.ts` for mock service injection
- Tests can now inject mock services easily

### 6. **Typed Requests & Async Error Handling** ✅
- Using `AuthenticatedRequest` type consistently across controllers
- Created `asyncHandler` utility to wrap async controller methods
- Removed try-catch blocks from controllers
- Error handling is now centralized through the error middleware

### 7. **Consolidated Server Files** ✅
- Deleted deprecated `server-simple.ts`
- Main `server.ts` now handles both simple and full modes via `SIMPLE_MODE` environment variable

## Benefits Achieved

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Eliminated duplicate authentication checks across controllers
- Removed duplicate server initialization code
- Centralized error handling logic

### Single Responsibility Principle
- Controllers focus only on business logic
- Authentication is handled by middleware
- Error handling is separated into its own middleware
- Configuration is centralized in one module

### Open/Closed Principle
- New services can be added to DI container without modifying existing code
- New routes can use existing middleware without duplication

### Dependency Inversion Principle
- Controllers depend on service interfaces, not concrete implementations
- Services are injected through DI container
- Tests can easily inject mock implementations

### Interface Segregation Principle
- Clear service interfaces defined for each domain
- Controllers only depend on the interfaces they need

## Testing Improvements

- Tests can now use `createTestApp()` with mock services
- No dependency on compiled artifacts in `dist/`
- Type-safe mock service creation with `createMockService()`

## Usage Examples

### Using the async handler with authentication:
```typescript
// In routes file
router.get("/profile", asyncHandler(ProfileController.getProfile));
```

### Creating a test with mock services:
```typescript
const app = createTestApp({
  mockServices: {
    EchoScoreService: createMockService(['calculateEchoScore', 'getHistory'])
  }
});
```

### Running in simple mode:
```bash
SIMPLE_MODE=true npm run dev
# or
npm run dev:simple
```

## Future Improvements

1. Add proper interfaces for remaining services (LeaderboardService, ChallengeStatsService, etc.)
2. Convert remaining static services to injectable classes
3. Add request validation middleware
4. Implement proper logging service through DI
