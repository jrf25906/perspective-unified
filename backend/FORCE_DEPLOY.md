# Force Railway Deployment

Deploy triggered at: 2025-07-02T23:35:00Z

## Critical Fixes Included:

1. **Missing await keywords in authController.ts** (commit 4dbd541)
   - This is THE critical fix that resolves 500 errors
   - Without this, Promise objects are returned instead of user data

2. **SafeUserStatsService** (commit ce14842) 
   - Handles missing user_challenge_stats table gracefully
   - Returns default stats instead of throwing errors

3. **DirectAuthController** (commit c320a7c)
   - Test endpoints that bypass transformation
   - Confirms core auth functionality works

## Current Status:
- DirectAuthController: ✅ Deployed
- SafeUserStatsService: ✅ Deployed
- Await fixes: ❌ NOT DEPLOYED (critical)

Railway must deploy commit 4dbd541 for auth to work.
